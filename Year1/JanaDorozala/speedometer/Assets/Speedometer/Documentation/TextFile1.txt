In order to use the Speedometer, the script: 'speed_detection', the object you want to measure the speed of needs
to have a 'Rigidbody2D' atached to it. You will need to have a Canvas and Text in your scene to show the speed.

In the script, in line 20, the speed from the 'Rigidbody2D' gets multiplied to convert into miles per hour. 
If you want to change to a different unit you will just have to change the factor after the * to the right scale factor
of meters per second to your preffered unit. 

In line 21 it prints the speed on the text field in the scene. The "F1" rounds our number to one decimal place,
you can change that to your liking if you prefer more or less. You can customize the text you want it show
where the " mph" is located in the script. You can further adept wich font you want in Unity.
