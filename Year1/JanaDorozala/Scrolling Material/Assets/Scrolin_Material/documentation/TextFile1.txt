Scrolling Texture

In order to use the script to scroll the texture you will need to have the image texture of what you want 
to scroll and make sure that it has a seemless transition. 
In Unity you will need to create a new material but before that make sure to go the inspector of the image and change the 
'Wrap Mode' to repeat. Afterwards you can simply drag the picture into the 'Albedo' setting in the Inspector of your new material.

When you have your desired object with your desired material applied to it you also have to attach the script to the Game Object.
When you know look at the Inspector of your Game Object you can see the variables 'ScrollX' and 'ScrillY', theese allow you to
change the direction and speed of the scrolling.
